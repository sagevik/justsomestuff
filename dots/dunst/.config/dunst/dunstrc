# You can also allow a notification to appear even when paused. Notification will appear whenever notification's override_pause_level >= dunst's paused level.

# override_pause_level = X

# SCRIPTING
# You can specify a script that gets run when the rule matches by
# setting the "script" option.

#   script appname summary body icon urgency
# where urgency can be "LOW", "NORMAL" or "CRITICAL".

# to find fitting options for rules.
